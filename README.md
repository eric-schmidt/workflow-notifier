# Workflow Notifier

A Contentful App that ties two missing pieces together:

1. A **Stakeholders field editor** for picking users from a Space and storing them on an entry as JSON.
2. An **App Event handler** that watches Workflow step changes and, on the configured trigger steps, creates a Contentful Task for each stakeholder on the entry's linked brand(s).

The intended flow:

> An entry referencing one or more brands moves through a Workflow. When it
> reaches a configured step (e.g. "Ready for review"), every user listed as a
> stakeholder on those brands automatically gets a Task on the entry asking
> them to review it.

## How it fits together

```

The **Field app** (`src/locations/Field.tsx`) populates the JSON. The **App Event Handler function** (`functions/notifications.ts`) consumes it. The **ConfigScreen** (`src/locations/ConfigScreen.tsx`) is where you pick which workflow + step pairs should fire the handler.

## Stakeholders Field

`src/locations/Field.tsx` renders on any JSON field a brand uses to store stakeholders. It:

- Fetches every user in the current Space via `sdk.cma.user.getManyForSpace`.
- Lets editors search and pick users via a Forma 36 `Autocomplete`.
- Renders each selection as a removable `Pill`.
- Persists the selection as `Array<{ userId, firstName, lastName }>` on the JSON field.

Picker UX lives in a shared component, `src/components/PillSelector.tsx`, so the same widget powers both this field and the ConfigScreen's trigger picker.

Field configuration recommendation in Contentful:
- Field type: **JSON object**
- Field id: `stakeholders` (or any name — the function reads the field by id from the brand entry, currently `stakeholders`).

## Workflow Notifier ConfigScreen

`src/locations/ConfigScreen.tsx` lists every Workflow Definition in the current environment (`sdk.cma.workflowDefinition.getMany`), flattens them to one row per `(workflow → step)`, and lets the installer pick which steps should trigger the notifier. Selections persist as installation parameters:

```ts
type WorkflowStepTrigger = {
  workflowDefinitionId: string;
  workflowDefinitionName: string;
  stepId: string;
  stepName: string;
};
type AppInstallationParameters = { triggers: WorkflowStepTrigger[] };
```

## Notifications App Event Function

`functions/notifications.ts` is registered in `contentful-app-manifest.json` as an `appevent.handler`. It expects to be wired to the **`Workflow.save`** topic on the app's event subscription.

On each event it:

1. Reads `stepId` from the event body and `workflowDefinitionId` / `entryId` from the body's `sys.workflowDefinition` and `sys.entity` links. (The `Workflow.save` payload is the Workflow entity itself — `WorkflowProps` from `contentful-management`, not the legacy changelog shape.)
2. Bails if `(workflowDefinitionId, stepId)` isn't in the installation's `triggers`.
3. Fetches the triggering entry, reads its `brands` array field.
4. Fetches each linked brand entry and unions all `stakeholders[].userId` values across them — one task per unique user.
5. Creates a Contentful Task on the triggering entry per stakeholder, with body `"<adminTitle> is ready for your review."` and `assignedTo: Link<User>`.

### Hardcoded field IDs

The function reads three fields by id. Change these constants at the top of `functions/notifications.ts` if your content model uses different names:

| Constant | Default | Lives on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRAND_FIELD_ID` | `'brands'` | The entry that fires the workflow |
| `STAKEHOLDERS_FIELD_ID` | `'stakeholders'` | The linked brand entries |
| `ADMIN_TITLE_FIELD_ID` | `'adminTitle'` | The triggering entry (used in the task body) |

### Wiring the subscription (one-time, per app definition)

After deploying:

1. In the Contentful web app, open the App Definition for this app.
2. **Events** tab → enable events.
3. Subscribe to topic `Workflow.save`.
4. Link the `notifications` function to the subscription.

### Debugging

CMA errors inside Contentful Functions surface as opaque `{ remote: true }` rejections — the underlying message is lost across the function boundary. The handler logs every early-return and every failed `task.create`; if a fan-out fails, log the inputs and reproduce the same CMA call against the plain client to see the real error.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Vite dev server for the frontend locations |
| `npm run build` | Builds the frontend AND bundles `functions/` via `contentful-app-scripts build-functions` |
| `npm run build:functions` | Just the function bundle |
| `npm run upload` | Interactive upload of `build/` (frontend + functions + manifest) |
| `npm run upload-ci` | Same, but reads `CONTENTFUL_ORG_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_APP_DEF_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` from env |
| `npm test` / `npm run test:ci` | Vitest |
| `npm run create-app-definition` | Interactive scaffold of a new app definition in Contentful |
| `npm run add-locations` | Adds locations to an existing app definition |

## Stack

- [Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/) — design system
- [`@contentful/app-sdk`](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/sdk/) — runtime SDK for the locations
- [`@contentful/react-apps-toolkit`](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/react-apps-toolkit/) — `useSDK`, `useAutoResizer`, auto-authed CMA client
- [`@contentful/node-apps-toolkit`](https://github.com/contentful/node-apps-toolkit) — types and runtime for App Event functions
- [`contentful-management`](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js) — CMA client used by both the ConfigScreen and the function
- Vite + Vitest

## Out of scope (today)

- Localized stakeholders / brand fields — the function reads whichever locale the field happens to define.
- Auto-resolving tasks when the workflow leaves the trigger step.
- Backfill for entries already past the trigger step at install time.
